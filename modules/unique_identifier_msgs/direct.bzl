    # with the same name and different parameters and you would not get any warning/error.
    #
    # One option is to check if it is already available in the existing_rules and only
    # call http_archive if it is not present. In the else you could display a message in
    # case that was already present but in reality you would only want a warning/error if was
    # already called with different parameters (different library version for example).
    #
    # Another option is to wrap the http_archive in a maybe call but this will also not display
    # a warning. It behaves like the if check with the advantage that the name has not to be
    # repeated
